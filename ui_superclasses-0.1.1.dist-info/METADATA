# Description
This 'Source_Backup' folder serves 2 purposes.

- 1. When building the installer, the source code must be 'moved' so that the 
installer does not install the native py files.  That way, once installed, students 
cannot view the python code.
- 2. Since the source code resides in this folder, the html-style documentation for 
the superclasses also resides in this folder.

## Maintenance
- If the source code changes, the source code will need to TEMPORARILY be placed back in the ui_superclasses directory so that it can be re-built for distribution.  Once it has been 
rebuilt - but BEFORE generating the distributable file, place the updated source code back in this directory.  See the documentation in the setup.py file in the ui_superclasses directory for complete instructions.
- To update the documentation, sphinx will need to be installed.  use the following command:
    pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild
    
- If the documentation changes:
- - delete the docs/_build folder and 
- - run the following command from the docs/ directory:

    sphinx-build -b html . _build
- The updated documentation will be placed into the _build directory.
